        <img src="images/rosario.webp" alt="Rosario" width="200">
        <p>Rosario is the largest city in the province of Santa Fe, in central Argentina. Rosario is the third most
            populous city in the country, and is also the most populous city in Argentina that is not a provincial
            capital. One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical architecture that has been retained over the
            centuries in hundreds of residences, houses, and public buildings.</p>
